- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @stepananchugov
- I'm a backend developer for @printify. I've been working with Symfony since 2.0 was released, and the more I did it, 
the more I understood that CQRS/ES was the right way to go.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m quite info functional programming. I love Clojure and Lisps!
- ðŸ“« Reach out to me on Slack or via e-mail: stepan.anchugov@printify.com
